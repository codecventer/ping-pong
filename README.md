## Ping Pong
This Node.js application can be described as a work in progress. The idea behind this application is to provide the user with a ping pong game made with JavaScript.

In short, the application makes use of a 2-dimensional array to create a table area. The user is then able to move the ball object around inside this area with error messages in place should the ball move outside the table area.

## Tech/Frameworks Used
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Features
- Table area
- Ball object
- Movement of the ball within the table area

## Getting Started
#### Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/codecventer/ping-pong.git
```
#### Navigate to index.js:
```
cd ping-pong-main
```
```
cd Ping\ Pong/
```
#### Run the application:
```
node index
```

## How To Use?
When the game is started, users are presented with a table area displayed in the console with an initial position of the ball.

Users can then simply use the arrow keys to move the ball within the table area before being met with an appropriate error message should the ball move out of bounds.

## Current Issues
- The ball object has no visual representation on the table area during gameplay.
- Paddle objects should also be added for a more realistic ping pong gameplay to incorporate multi-player functionality.
